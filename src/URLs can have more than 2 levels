URLs can have more than 2 levels
URLs should not have sensitive and personal information
URLs can have product / functionality / feature names (Use business terms or in a way end user understands the url paths)
Shorten the urls as much as possible (with meaningful names) for ex: www.idfcbank.com/applyloan
Campaign links will have /dl/ as an identifier ex: www.idfcbank.com/dl/hhekr23432kjbkj234
Use only lowercase in the url. Do not use either technical or tab names, Use business terms or in a way end user understands the url paths
Use uniform pattern in the url (Do not user camelcase, special characters, lowercases and uppercases altogether)
Every page should be mapped with a URL
Every acquisition flow should be mapped with a URL (Ex: Fund transfer, apply loan, create FD and RD)
Every account specific, user specific information in the URL will be replaced with a universal id (Corresponding APIs will provide us all the required information)
When there are multiple dynamic data in URL, it will be clubbed under one universal id and the required information will be given by the appropriate APIs (For example: If we make CHANGE NOMINEE mapped with a URL, we need to provide two informations in the URL, say Account ID and Nominee Name, in this case, your API will provide a URL with a single universal ID, say instead of
/accounts/{ACCOUNT_HASH}/nominee/{NOMINEE_HASH}/edit it will be /accounts/nominee/edit/{COMBINED_HASH}

)
Flow models with multiple flows within a feature should be covered with only one URL, for example: buy gold loan modal has 3 pages, one for fill up the required data, then a confirmation of given details and then a success page, For this case, the URL should be like /investments/buygold only. This is applicable for every transactional modal which has multiple transitions within the flow modal.
Accounts details, deposit details and load details etc.., (COTS related) pages have to be linked with a URL along with a universal ID which points to the corresponding actual reference. Example: /have/accounts/adDSojfsD12Ds will be pointing to a particular account details. Currently implementation does not have this option but we have to make it work with the help of some API wrappers.
Both mobile and web have similar urls for pointing corresponding pages
Universal search results should have only the links with Universal ID along with the required display data.


Why universal ID?

As per ISG standards, no personal or account related information should be present in the URLs.



How universal IDs are possible and how would it be mapped with the actual data?

There is new API service called MAPPER, which helps us creating universal IDs for respected data, which can be consumed by the respective APIs in the app.

Going forward, only the universal IDs will be used for any reference.



Few example URLs

For account details, instead of https://app.dev-opt.idfcbank.com/have/accounts/12345678 it will be https://app.dev-opt.idfcbank.com/have/accounts/803f2de986884b4c9d92817c8cdf2d3b

For change nominee we need 2 information, instead of  https://app.dev-opt.idfcbank.com/have/accounts/0c28ae1a37a849a0b4201805425cd3eb/nominee/0fsffae1a37a849a0b4201805425cd3eb/edit it will be https://app.dev-opt.idfcbank.com/have/accounts/nominee/edit/34827yfuishfkj3284rhskfd23

For create fixed deposit, instead of https://app.dev-opt.idfcbank.com/have/deposits it will be https://app.dev-opt.idfcbank.com/have/deposits/createfd
